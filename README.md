# ðŸ‘„ Lip Reader using Deep Learning

This project implements a deep learning-based lip-reading system capable of recognizing spoken words from silent video footage. The goal is to convert visual mouth movements into corresponding text using a combination of convolutional and recurrent neural networks.

## ðŸ“Œ Project Description

The **Lip Reader** project is built using Python and TensorFlow. It processes video data to detect, isolate, and interpret lip movements to predict spoken words or characters. This is particularly useful for aiding speech-impaired individuals, silent communication, and improving accessibility in noisy environments.

### ðŸŽ¯ Key Objectives

- Preprocess and prepare video datasets for deep learning.
- Isolate and normalize lip region features from grayscale video frames.
- Model both spatial and temporal dependencies of lip movements.
- Convert video sequences into meaningful textual output using a trained model.

### ðŸ§± Major Components

#### 1. **Data Preprocessing**
- Videos are converted to grayscale for lower computational cost.
- Lip regions are extracted based on statistical spatial information.
- Normalization using mean and standard deviation ensures stable training.

#### 2. **Alignment Processing**
- Text alignments are tokenized and mapped using Keras' `StringLookup`.
- Silences (`"sil"`) are removed for clarity in the model's learning.
- Tokens are converted between characters and numeric formats.

#### 3. **Model Architecture**
- Built using a `Sequential` model in TensorFlow.
- Utilizes **Conv3D** layers for spatiotemporal feature extraction from videos.
- **LSTM** layers are used to capture sequential lip movement patterns.
- Activation functions like **ReLU** and operations like **MaxPooling3D** enhance feature learning.
- **CTC (Connectionist Temporal Classification)** loss is used to handle variable-length sequences without explicit alignment.

#### 4. **Training and Optimization**
- The model is trained with the **Adam optimizer** for adaptive learning.
- **Learning rate scheduling** and **ModelCheckpoint** are used for efficient training.
- The training process is resumed from a pretrained checkpoint (97 epochs).

#### 5. **Prediction Pipeline**
- The model makes predictions on `.mpg` video files using the trained checkpoint.
- Visual frames are passed through the model to produce corresponding characters or words.
